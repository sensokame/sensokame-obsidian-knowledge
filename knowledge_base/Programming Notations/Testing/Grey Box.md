# Grey Box
This is the most popular testing method for penetration testing. it is a combination of both [[White Box]] and [[Black Box]] testing. in this process, a tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application. but the tester will still interact with the application as a normal user, using [[Black Box]] techniques.
