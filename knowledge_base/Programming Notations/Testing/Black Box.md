# Black Box
Black Box testing if the process of conducting different tests on a system in which the tester has no information about the inner workings of an application.
The tester then acts as a regular user trying to find ways to interact with the machine and to break it.
Black Box testing would usually increase the [[Intelligence or Information Gathering]] phase to better understand attack vectors on the target.
