# White Box
White box testing is a low level process usually done by the developer himself who knows the programming and application logic. the tester will be testing the internal components of the application, in this process the tester has full knowledge of the application and the expected behaviour. 
This process is much more time consuming than [[Black Box]] testing, as this approach should guarantee the entire attack surface can be validated.
Some examples of white box testing:
