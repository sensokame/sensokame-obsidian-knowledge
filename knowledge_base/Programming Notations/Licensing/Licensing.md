# Licensing
One of the most common parts about developing and using software is the licensing hell.
Every piece of software out there comes with a different kind of license. 
each license means different things for the users/distributors of said piece of software.
and depending on the use case, some pieces of software become unusable (legal hell) in the context of development process.
So when using 3rd part libraries or softwares, beware of the license that comes with it.

Licenses can be classified to the access they give the users.
