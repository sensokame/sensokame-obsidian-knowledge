# Code quality
There are several metrics to ensure code quality, one of these metrics is the [[complexity]] metric, which in usual situations (unless the coder is unable to) the less complex an algorithm the better it is.
>**NOTE:** code quality metrics are usually ensured by static code analysis tools, one of the biggest tools is [[SonarQube]] which works on many different languages across many different platforms and contains a huge library of rules that determine the code quality of a code base.

Other metrics for code quality include:
