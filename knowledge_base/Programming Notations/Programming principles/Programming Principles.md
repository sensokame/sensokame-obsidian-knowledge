# Programming principles
programming is a very wide field with countless technologies, frameworks, languages, etc.
the final goal of programming is to make a machine perform a specific task.
but since programming is a human action that may take long time, multiple contributors and several iterations, it is imperative to organise the programming process into principles, best case practices and proper ways of doing things.
in here we will mention some of the widely adapted principles that are used today in programming:
- [[SOLID Principles]]
	- [[Single Responsibility principle]]
	- [[Open-closed Principle]]
	- [[Liskov substitution principle]]
	- [[Interface segregation principle]]
	- [[dependency inversion principle]]
