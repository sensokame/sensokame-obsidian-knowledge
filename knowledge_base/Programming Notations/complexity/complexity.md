# Complexity
Programming complexity is a very broad term that includes many metrics for calculating how complex (not to be confused with complicated) a piece of software is
>**NOTE:** complex and complicated are very distinct, as a software can be complex but not complicated and the other way around.
>To know more about complexity we can check the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_complexity)

We can also talk about Computational complexity, which is basically the amount of resources required to run it, this term contains: 
- [[time complexity]]
- [[space complexity]]

>**NOTE:** Computational complexity is the defining caracteristic of which algorithms are better than others.

Some of the metrics for knowing the complexity of a piece of software we can use:
- [Cyclomatic complexity]([Cyclomatic complexity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)): this is a static analysis of the code and is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.
