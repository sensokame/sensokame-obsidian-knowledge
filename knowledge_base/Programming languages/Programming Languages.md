# Programming Languages
as we are aware, we need to tell machines what to do (we need to program machines to do what we want). 
it is impracticle (and nearly impossible) to actually tell the machine what to do in its native language (binary), so from here came the rise of programming languages, a language that is humanly readable, which can then be compiled or executed to work on the native hardware of the machine. 

Programming Languages can be classified by many different ways. 
>**NOTE:** more often than not, some languages will belong to more than one group inside a classification, example being [[c++]] which is both a procedural and an object oriented programming language

## Compiled vs interpreted languages
a very common classification for programming language is what happens after writing the code is done, 
- [[Compiled languages]], which have to go through [[compilation]]
- [[Interpreted languages]] which just run on the fly
>**NOTE:** a simple comparison shows that compiled languages are usually faster but interpreted languages are more portable and easier. check the [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3265602) for more information.

Some languages attempt to keep the portability feature of interpreted languages with the speed feature of compiled languages, one of which is Java, it does this by compiling not into machine code, but to special code called bytecode which is then ran on a virtual platform called Java virtual machine (JVM), this makes Java relatively faster than interpreted languages while keeping the portability feature.
