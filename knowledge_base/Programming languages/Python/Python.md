# Python
Python is probably one of the best beginner friendly programming languages out there. not to be confused with useless, Python is still capable of extremely complex coding. Specially with the mirade of C powered libraries it has like `numpy` and `pandas`, Python is still relatively slow compared to other programming languages, but thanks to the C compiled libraries it has, it is still the go to language for things like AI and data science.

# What is python
Python is an interpreted language (as opposed to compiled language), this means that python code can be executed directly as it is without the need to compile it to machine language.
This makes python easier to work with, portable, and beginner friendly, but this comes with a little sacrifice of execution speed.
