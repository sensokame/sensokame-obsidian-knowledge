# Python
Python is probably one of the best beginner friendly programming languages out there. not to be confused with useless, Python is still capable of extremely complex coding. Specially with the myriad of C powered libraries it has like `numpy` and `pandas`, Python is still relatively slow compared to other programming languages, but thanks to the C compiled libraries it has, it is still the go to language for things like AI and data science.

# What is python
Python is an interpreted language (as opposed to compiled language), this means that python code can be executed directly as it is without the need to compile it to machine language.
This makes python easier to work with, portable, and beginner friendly, but this comes with a little sacrifice of execution speed.
Python comes backed with a huge community of developers, which contributes to the ever growing list of libraries, these libraries are usually accessible via a PyPi repository, with the most famous and stable one being the public python package index [PyPi](https://pypi.org) 

It is important to note that PyPi is a public repository, so in theory, you can push your python libraries after packaging them into whl and tar.gz files (for this we can use [[PyInstaller]] or the build module that comes with python), and as long as the package is well maintained and useful, it will stay there for people to use.

## Getting started with Python
To get started with python, we need to install the interpreter of our choosing,
