# introduction
blue team activities consist mainly of fortifying the security of a system (defensive actions)

These actions can consist of 
- patching/updating a system or its applications
- setting up monitoring and logging
- setting up security devices, mainly firewalls
- teaching users

> **_NOTE:_** it is very important to keep the system up to date as security patches would fix security issues and vulnerablities
> **NOTE:** check [[Vulnerabilities]] page for more information  

Blue team would most likely have a SOC . A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. 
The SOC team would take care of:
- [[Vulnerabilities]]
- [[Policy Violation]]
- [[Unauthorized Activity]]
- [[Network Intrusion]]

The way to get around and ensure the protection against these issues is [[Threat Intelligence]] 

Blue team would also need a DFIR team, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR);
This team would take care of:
- [[Digital Forensics]] (Preemptive measure)
- [[Incident Response]] (Healing/fixing)
- [[Malware Analysis]]
