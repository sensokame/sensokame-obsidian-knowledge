# Incident Response
An incident is when an attack happens and it's up to the blue team to handle it.
When an incident happens, these steps are usually taken:
- Preparation: Usually preventive measures
- Detection and Analysis: detecting incidents is usually done with logs and sniffing tools
- Containment, Eradication and Recovery: this is the part where the team stops the breach and attempts to fix it with applying patch and whatnot
- Post-Incident Activity: filing report and making sure that the incident will not happen again
