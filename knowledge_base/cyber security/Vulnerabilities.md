# Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability is basically a flaw in the system that can be exploited to cause unintentional behavior.

> **Note:** Vulnerabiltiies are the holy grail of an attacker and the worst fear of a defender.
>  the job of an attacker is to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to a system.
>  the job of a defender if patch or fix vulnerabilities to stop attackers from exploiting them.

When enumerating a machine, it's important to detect the versions of the applications being run on that machine, as different versions of different applications could present different attack vectors (vulneratbilities)

there exists several exploit/vulnerabilities databases, the most famous and open source one can be accessed via the [exploit database]([Exploit Database - Exploits for Penetration Testers, Researchers, and Ethical Hackers (exploit-db.com)](https://www.exploit-db.com/))
there are other databases for known vulnerabilities, the easiest way is to google the software along with its version and you will find the exploits possible.

> **Note:** some tools like Metaspoloit framework can have exploits ready for the different vulnerabilities
