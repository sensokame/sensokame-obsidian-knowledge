# capture the flag
Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defence-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges). Several variations exist, including hiding flags in hardware devices. Competitions exist both online and in-person, and can be advanced or entry-level.
CTFs are great ways of improving a hackers skill, as it provides a highly competitive safe environment in which a hacker can practice and learn new skills.
as mentioned above, CTFs could be in many formats:
- Full Pwn-Style: in here, the players are given vulnerable machines, and are supposed to gain elevated privileges access to the machine (root access) to find the flag
- AD-Style: active directory style
- Jeopardy-Style: basically, different challenges, with many sub categories, each focuses on a single vulnerability/technique (as opposed to full pwn where you might have to combine many techniques)
- King of the hill: this is a derivation from the Full Pwn style, in which a group of players compete to gain access to the machine and then block other players from gaining access. the person who maintains access for the longest time is crowned the king of the hill at the end of the game.
When training, hackers would usually experiment with jeopardy style challenges, as these would focus on a single vulnerability/technique, these challenges can be divided into several categories:
- web: related to [[Web Application Security]]
- reversing: [[reverse engineering]] (binaries)
- [[pwn]]
- [[forensics]]
- crypto ([[cryptography]])
- [[hardware]]
- stego ([[steganography]])
- [[OSINT]] (open source intelligence)
- [[Blockchain]]
- [[PPC]] (professional programming and coding)
- [[Miscellaneous]] : challenges that don't fall into other categories
> usually hackers would be more skilled in some fields more than others, so you'd usually find teams where members try to balance the different skills.

## Getting started with CTFs
There are plenty of CTF competitions out there, and a hacker could always be in competition
a great place to find active CTF competitions is to access [CTFtime.org / All about CTF (Capture The Flag)](https://ctftime.org/) this is a great website that hosts a calendar of past present and upcoming CTF competitions, the website also holds a big database of writeups for different challenges.

As a hacker, if you're not participating in CTFs, you are training for CTFs, this is done by learning as much as possible, and there are multiple platforms out there for learning that range from beginner friendly to extremely difficult.
Some of these ways of learning include:
- training with old CTF materials: some CTFs would keep their challenges online for people to train with. 
- Cyber Security Platforms
