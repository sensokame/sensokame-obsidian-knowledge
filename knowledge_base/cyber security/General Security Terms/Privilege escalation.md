# Privilege escalation
Once a foothold on the system or the application is gained through [[exploitation]], this phase in an attempt to expand the access to the system.
Two ways of escalation are possible
## Horizontal Escalation
This is the process of gaining access to other accounts in the same permission group (other users)
## Vertical Escalation
this is the process of gaining access to other accounts in different permission groups (usually admin or root)
