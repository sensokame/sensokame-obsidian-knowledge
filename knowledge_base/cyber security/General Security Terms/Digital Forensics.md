These assets can be one of the following
- File System
- System Memory
- System logs
- Network logs

## Digital Forensic Job
digital forensics are usually part of law enforcement who gather physical devices and analyze them.
digital forensics can also be conducted by black hat hackers who get their hands on dump or log files
it is important to have an understanding of how digital forensics work as it gives an overview of how systems work
# Digital forensics process
From law enforcement point of view, the digital forensics process is usually as follows
- In the crime scene
	- acquire the evidence: collect digital devices
	- establish chain of custody
	- place evidence in secure container
	- transport evidence to digital forensics lab
- at the lab
	- retrieve the digital evidence from the container
	- create a forensic copy of the evidence (This is important when working with forensic evidence as to make sure that any modification to it do not damage the original or cost data to be lost.)
	- Start processing the copy in the workstation

More generally, digital forensics include
- proper search authority
- chain of custody
- calidation with mathematics
- use of validated tools
- repetabality
- reporting

as an amateur hacker, one will need some basic idea on different forensics processing technologies, for that you won't need the forensics process, just the forensic assets.
