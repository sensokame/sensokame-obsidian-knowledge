# Network Security
most people confuse web security with web app security, but these are two different concepts, web apps are usually accessible via user interface served on a browser, but that's not the only way that machines are connected to the internet, and a good penetration tester knows his way around the entire network and not just the web apps.

The steps usually needed to break into a network are as follows
- [[Recon]]
- [[Weaponization]]
- [[Delivery]]
- [[exploitation]]
- [[installation]]
- [[Command and control]]
- [[Action on objectives]]
