# Identification and authentication failures
this is when there is a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism which allows the user to exploit the system and gain access as a normal user.
this can include:
- using brute forcing to gain access
- allowing the user to use weak passwords
- passwords being stored as plain text, meaning that if the attacker gains access to the database, they can easily retrieve the passwords.
