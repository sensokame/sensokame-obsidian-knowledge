# Cryptographic failures
in our ever increasing connected world, we grow to need [[Encryption]] more and more, this vulneratbility is when encrypted content can be decrypted by attackers. or when sensitive data is not encrypted (properly)
this vulnerability can happen when one of the following happens:
- sending sensitive data in clear text (not using HTTPS)
- using weak or old [[cryptographic algorithms]]
- using default or weak keys for [[cryptographic algorithms]]
