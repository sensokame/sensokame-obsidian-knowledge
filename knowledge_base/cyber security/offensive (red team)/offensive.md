# Offensive
Red team activities consist of mostly trying to find vulnerabilities in a system.
people usually classify red team activities based on their vulnerability finding objective to one of these:
- White hat hackers: these are the people whose objective of finding vulnerability is to report and patch them, these are usually cyber security experts or bug bounty hunters
- Black hat hackers: these are the people with malicious intents behind their activities, the intents could range from information gathering to money theft or anything in between
- Grey hat hackers: these are the hackers who are moody, sometimes white, sometimes black, depending on context.
>**NOTE:** a white hat hacker can be a part of a multitude of teams (big career path), this can possibly include
>- Security Analyst
>- Security Engineer
>- Incident Responder
>- Digital Forensics Examiner
>- Malware Analyst
>- [[Penetration Tester]]
>- Red Teamer
>**NOTE:** The difference between a Penetration Tester and a Red Teamer is that the Red teamer is basically an external to the system and will attempt to break the system from outside the network with no prior knowledge while attempting to avoid detection, a red teamer basically acts like a black hat hacker in an attempt to uncover defects in the system, while a penetration tester is usually working from within the company to uncover defects with prior knowledge about the system.
>**NOTE:** One can also work as a bounty hunter, where the hacker would hunt for bugs in the system and report them to the creator company for a bounty, many companies offer bug bounty program to incentivize people to report the bugs that they find.


## Offensive tools
most offensive activities are done with the help of tools, these tools can either be made by someone else (the community), or developed personally. depending on the context.
>**NOTE:** tools alone are never enough, the true tool of a hacker is their knowledge and the experience the gain along the way. it's important to understand the different technologies, research what can be done. and not be shy to ask questions.

tools will be mentioned as neede, but the comprehensive list can be accessed directly at [[Offensive tools]]
