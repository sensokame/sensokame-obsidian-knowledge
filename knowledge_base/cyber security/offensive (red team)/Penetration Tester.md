# Penetration Tester
A penetration tesster is someone who performs an ethically driver attempt to test and analyse the security defences of an organization, this is very similar to a red teamer with the subtle difference that usually a penetration tester does not usually care about being discrete.

## Getting Started with penetration testing
Before starting the audit, a penetration tester would have a discussion with the organization to determine the scope of the penetration testing, the different tools and techniques to be used the systems to be tested. this in a way what determines the limits of what a penetration tester would do.
> The penetration tester is now allowed to keep any sensitive data they uncover during their audit

After setting the scope of the penetration, the pentesters would conduct the test and report the findings alongside recommendations to the organization.

>It is worth mentioning, that once a company is about to conduct a penetration test, it defines a rules of engagement document with the pentester specifying the permission, the test scope and the rules.

## Penetration Testing process
Generally, a penetration testing process goes as follows:
- [[Intelligence or Information Gathering]]
- [[Enumeration or Scanning]]
- [[exploitation]]
- [[Privilege escalation]]
- [[Post exploitation]]

### OSSTMM
a detailed framework for testing strategies can be accessed via the [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf), this methodology focuses primarily on how the systems communicate, so it mostly focuses on 
- [[Telecommunication]]
- [[Wired Networks]]
- [[Wireless communication]]

### OWASP
the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/) is sort of like a pentesters bible, this project aims at making the internet a more secure place, they do so by regularly writing reports and articles and releasing ways of the exploits found in applications and how to secure them.
>**NOTE:** OWASP is dedicated towards we applications
### NIST
[NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) is a popular framework used to improve the cybersecurity of an organization
### NCSC CAF
The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/cyber-assessment-framework) is another framework, this framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:
- Data security 
- System security 
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency 
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning
This framework is backed by a government agency making it more prestigious.

## Categorization
We can categorize pentesting into one of three categories
- [[Black Box]]
- [[White Box]]
- [[White Box]]
