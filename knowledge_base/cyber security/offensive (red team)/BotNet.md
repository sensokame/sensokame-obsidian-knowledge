# BotNet
After taking control of a machine, the hacker then has the ability to "recruit" this new machine into their network of compromised machines, and then given enough privileges, the hacker can make the machine execute any operation they so desire.
given enough number of machines, the hacker will have control of a big network of machines, otherwise known as BotNet
managing a big number of machines is usually done with the help of a [[Command and control]] software that keeps track of the compromised machines and makes them work together on the same (or different) task.
