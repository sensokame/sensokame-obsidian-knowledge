# nmap
The Network Mapper, is arguably the most famous network mapper out there.
nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analysing the responses. nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.
the reason why nmap is extremely popular can be contributed to many things, namely nmap has been around since 1997 and is still under active development until now, secondly, nmap is very efficient at what it does, is extremely customizable and  it comes with a powerful scripting capability that allows it to be extended to do more mapping and might even check for vulnerabilities or run exploits.
