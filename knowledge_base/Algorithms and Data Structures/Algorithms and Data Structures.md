# Algorithms and Data Structures

It is very important to be able to identify the best algorithms and data structures to use in a specific problem set; 

the correct data structure will greately decrease the [[time complexity]] and possibly* the [[space complexity]] of a function or program

> **NOTE:** we say possibly, because time and space complexities can present a tradeoff opportunity where you have to chose the optimal complexity for your algorithm, because in most cases reducing time complexity means increasing space complexity; so it's important to be able to determine the best solution

There are plenty or sources online on learning algorithms and data structures, the best one i found so far is the [google interview preaparation blog](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/), we can alternatively check all of [google's tips on dev](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/) 
>`When in doubt, throw a hashmap at the problem`

Usually, every data structure has the following possible actions or operation
- Addition
- Removing 
- Insertion
- Access
- Search
- Check if element exists (search without retrieve)
>One needs to know the benefits and drawbacks of every data structure by knowing the complexity of each operation, for example an array has an access complexity of O(1) making it incredibly fast when knowing the index of the needed element (and the total size of the data)
