# Algorithms and Data Structures

It is very important to be able to identify the best algorithms and data structures to use in a specific problem set; 

the correct data structure will greately decrease the [[time complexity]] and possibly* the [[space complexity]] of a function or program

> **NOTE:** we say possibly, because time and space complexities can present a tradeoff opportunity where you have to chose the optimal complexity for your algorithm, because in most cases reducing time complexity means increasing space complexity; so it's important to be able to determine the best solution
