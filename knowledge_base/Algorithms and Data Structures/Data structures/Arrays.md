# Arrays
an array is a sequential list of data, usually an array is defined by two main properties, a capacity for the maximum number of elements that an array can store, and an index with which we can access the array

> **an array has O(1) access time, O(1) insertion time, and depending on the compiler and how the structure was built, up to O(n) search time**
> => an array is good for when you know the index of the elements but not for searching

most [[sorting algorithms]] are implemented to work with arrays. it could be useful to check the different algorithms and the [[time complexity]] of each one.
>**NOTE:** Sometimes you might need to sort your array before working on it
