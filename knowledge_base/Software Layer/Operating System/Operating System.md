# Operating System
An operating system is the first abstraction layer on top of the hardware layer.

in an average machine, to run an application, it needs to be compatible with the operating system which in turn needs to be compatible with the hardware layer.

the most known operating systems nowawdays are:
- [[Windows]]
- [[Linux]]
- [[Android]]
- [[Mac Os]]

Each operating system spawns different sub operating systems and images, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. each operating system has its own development guidelines and API, with [[Linux]] being the most open source one and [[Mac Os]] being the most closed source one.
